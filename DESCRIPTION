Description: This is a quick extension to Jenny Bryan’s googledrive package to 
  allow for grabbing data from Google Drive and returning it as an R object 
  without saving the object to the user’s local file system. This is meant 
  to allow for several people to work with the same data without having to 
  deal with downloading files, changing filepaths, and getwd() fussiness.
